# Feature Specification: HTTP Call CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-http-call-cli`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "HTTP Call CLI Tool"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or system administrator needs to make HTTP requests from the command line to test APIs, troubleshoot services, or automate HTTP-based interactions. They want a simple, reliable tool that allows them to specify HTTP methods, headers, request bodies, and URLs while receiving clear, formatted responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the CLI tool is installed, **When** a user runs a GET request to a valid URL, **Then** the response status, headers, and body are displayed in a readable format
2. **Given** the CLI tool is available, **When** a user makes a POST request with JSON data, **Then** the request is sent with proper content-type headers and the response is displayed
3. **Given** a user wants to test an API endpoint, **When** they specify custom headers (like Authorization), **Then** those headers are included in the HTTP request
4. **Given** the user runs the tool without arguments, **When** they need help, **Then** usage instructions and examples are displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the target URL is unreachable or invalid?
- How does the system handle network timeouts?
- What occurs when the response body is extremely large?
- How are non-UTF8 response bodies handled?
- What happens with redirect responses?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to specify target URLs via command line arguments
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to include custom headers in their requests
- **FR-004**: System MUST support sending request bodies for applicable HTTP methods
- **FR-005**: System MUST display response status codes, headers, and body content
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout duration not specified - default timeout value?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output format not specified - JSON, plain text, colored output?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication methods not specified - basic auth, bearer tokens, API keys?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error handling behavior not specified - retry logic, error codes?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: SSL/TLS verification behavior not specified - strict, ignore invalid certs?]

### Key Entities
- **HTTP Request**: Represents an outgoing HTTP request with method, URL, headers, and optional body
- **HTTP Response**: Represents the server's response including status code, headers, and body content
- **Configuration**: User-specified options for request customization (headers, timeouts, output format)
